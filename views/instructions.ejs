        <h1>1</h1>
        <p>You are going to start with what we call the “Left Task”.</p>

        <p>Here, you will be responding with your left hand. There are three buttons on the keyboard you can press when
            you
            hear a sound. If you hear a high-pitched voice say the word hi you will press the W key. If you hear a
            medium
            pitch
            sound say the word medium you will press the S key. And if you hear a low pitch sounds say the word low you
            will
            press the X key.</p>

        <p>Please keep the index, middle and ring fingers of your left hand rested on the three keys.</p>

        <p>Your goal is to respond at a rate that keeps the blue bar on the left side of the screen as low as possible.
            It's
            always Rising unless you respond accurately and promptly enough. Your goal is to drive the bar as low as
            possible.</p>

        <h1>2</h1>
        <p>Next you are going to try what we call the “Right Task”.</p>

        <p>Here, you will be responding with your right hand. There are three buttons on the keyboard you can press when
            you see a letter flash on the screen. If you see an A you will press the comma key. If you see a B you will
            press the period key. And if you see a C you will press the slash key.</p>

        <p>Please keep the index, middle and ring fingers of your right hand rested on the three keys.</p>

        <p>Your goal is to respond at a rate that keeps the red bar on the right side of the screen as low as possible.
            It's always Rising unless you respond accurately and promptly enough. Your goal is to drive the bar as low
            as possible.</p>

        <h1>3</h1>
        <p>Finally you are going to try the “Both Task”. Here you have both the Left Task and the Right Task going at
            the same time. Your job is to keep both bars as low as possible.</p>
